What is Social Informatics and Why Does it Matter?
==================================================

Hinne: 3 / 5

Most important keywords: user-centredness, social context,
socio-technical systems. Yes, one could say that they are
all there but what worries me is the length and under-structuration
of the summary meaning that the distinction between crucial
and not-that-crucial is incomplete at best (e.g. all the paragraphs
beginning from productivity paradox to technological determinism
could have been united under a single statement). Had you re-edited
your summary and written it into a more concise list of statements
with brief comments I would not have hesitated to award maximum points.


Find a Social informatics problem analyse it with SI tools
==========================================================

Hinne: 3 / 5

Quite good overall effort although it misses the point to the extent
that the questions are not really interrelated. You could have taken
only the first point and fleshed it out into a more nuanced research
framework because the puzzle itself is really good and practical.
I do have an issue with an expression 'contextual inquiry' because
that can mean anything - expert survey, participant observation, focus
group, ethnography, discourse analysis... THe choices are endless here.
The structure itself leaves something to be desired in that the points
are separated but under each heading the specific research questions,
methods and hypotheses are not.


Analyse the socio-technical system of a project
===============================================

Hinne: 5 / 5

Main expectations: many different categories with lots of relevant
examples of each, clear structure providing an easy overview of the
system, if possible, visualization. In this regard mostly well done.
However, I would have liked to see more about (potentially conflicting)
user expectations, organizational routines and habits etc. For example,
if ÕIS forces the student to give feedback the script that auto-completes
the survey illustrates conflicting user preferences.


Academic Research Paper on HCI
==============================

Hinne: 4 / 5

Main expectations: clear and brief summary of key ideas, good structure,
importance of the article has been justified. You have indeed managed to
provide an overview of the findings. What I did not see here was answer
to the question why the article was necessary in the first place? How
did it contribute to the existing knowledge pool? What were its wider
implications (if any)? As to your remark about the summary there are
couple of answers that come to mind: 1) as any summary involves a
selection of ideas it already includes your opinion of what is important
- there is no such thing as value-free choice (or that's what some
philosophers would claim); 2) it depends on the definition of summary;
3) we can retain the summary part as narrowly defined but still include
the reflection requirement in the assignment - so there, you can now
call it 'summary-and-opinion'; 4) the assignment was written by the
lecturer - I mark my own edits (if any) accordingly ;)

Visualise the domestication process
===================================

Hinne: 5 / 5

Main expectations: one clear and easy-to-read visualization of the
key idea(s) of the article with brief accompanying remarks about
the content. Yes, good. It is commendable that you tried to make
the model more accessible because the initial one does its best
to keep you from grasping the general idea. P.S. It is evident that
the academic background makes all the difference. Where I come
from - sociology and media studies - this would be considered an
easy bedtime read. Bad news is that from your point of view even
worse articles will follow :P


Analysis of domestication process
=================================

Hinne: 4 / 5

Main expectations: detailed but systematic description of enhancing
and obstructing factors, potential general lessons on the basis of
your own experience, drawing connections with prior knowledge.
Interesting topic! The description is a bit shallow at places -
would have liked to see even more details about the gradual
unfolding of the overall process - but sufficient. Generalization
in the end is also commendable. Could have drawn connections with
the theoretical framework though.


Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Power Inequalities
=====================================================================

Hinne: 0 / 5

Main expectation: two clear, logically consistent and reasonably
detailed examples (e.g. more general claim is coupled with a specific
instance) from both sides. In that regard I am sorry to say that you
have misunderstood the topic. What I would have expected is a discussion
of two specific instances (or one instance viewed from both sides)
discussing the possibility of ICT to make a difference. As I fail
to notice a re-submission box in this case please just re-submit it on my e-mail.
 
P.S. Agreed. I'm not too fond of Moodle as a whole myself...
