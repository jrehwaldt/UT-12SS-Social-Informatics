What is Social Informatics and Why Does it Matter?
==================================================

Hinne: 3 / 5

Most important keywords: user-centredness, social context,
socio-technical systems. Yes, one could say that they are
all there but what worries me is the length and under-structuration
of the summary meaning that the distinction between crucial
and not-that-crucial is incomplete at best (e.g. all the paragraphs
beginning from productivity paradox to technological determinism
could have been united under a single statement). Had you re-edited
your summary and written it into a more concise list of statements
with brief comments I would not have hesitated to award maximum points.

Quite good overall effort although it misses the point to the extent
that the questions are not really interrelated. You could have taken
only the first point and fleshed it out into a more nuanced research
framework because the puzzle itself is really good and practical.
I do have an issue with an expression 'contextual inquiry' because
that can mean anything - expert survey, participant observation, focus
group, ethnography, discourse analysis... THe choices are endless here.
The structure itself leaves something to be desired in that the points
are separated but under each heading the specific research questions,
methods and hypotheses are not.
